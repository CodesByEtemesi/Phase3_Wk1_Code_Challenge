Week 1 Code challenge

## Phase 3 Week 1(Python Toy Problems)

<h1>Author: Samwel Etemesi</h1>
<p>This project had three challenges that were supposed to be completed.</p><br>
<p>These challenges includes:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Write a function that, given an array A of N integers, returns the minimum number of moves needed to end up with exactly 10 bricks in every box. If this is not possible, the function should return âˆ’1.</li>
    <li>Write a function that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the maximum sum of two numbers whose digits add up to an equal sum. If there are no two numbers whose digits have an equal sum, the function should return -1.</li>
    <li>Write a function solution that, given an integer N, returns a string of length N containing as many different lower-case letters ('a'-'z') as possible, in which each letter occurs an equal number of times.</li>
